# 100 Days Of Code - Vlad Bogdan's Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 14, Thursday, 2017].

### Day 1: September 14, 2017 (Example 1)

**Progress**: I remade parts of code in my Random Quote Machine and made it responsive

**Thoughts:** When I've done this I didn't know much about responsive design and now I wanted to make it mobile friendly.

### Day 2: September 15, 2017 

**Progress**: I started the Twitch app today. I am overcomplicating it again...

**Thoughts**: This project is gonna be harder than I thought, at least from a design perspective. I've already faced problems and I've just started.

### Day 3: September 16, 2017 

**Progress**: I'm still on the Twitch project app, but it's starting to look like I wanted to.

**Thoughts**: It was a bit frustrating today because it didn't look good enough on the phone and I had to change some stuff.

**Progress**: Today I've finished the UI for the Twitch app.

**Thoughts**: Everything went according to plan :).
