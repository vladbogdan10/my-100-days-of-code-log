# 100 Days Of Code - Vlad Bogdan's Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 14, Thursday, 2017].

### Day 1: September 14, 2017 (Example 1)

**Progress**: I remade parts of code in my Random Quote Machine and made it responsive

**Thoughts:** When I've done this I didn't know much about responsive design and now I wanted to make it mobile friendly.
