# 100 Days Of Code - Vlad Bogdan's Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 14, Thursday, 2017].

### Day 1: September 14, 2017 (Example 1)

**Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
